# Bookshop-Inventory-System

Here the system maintains the inventory of books in a bookshop. 
If a customer purchases a book, the book's count will decrease; if a book is added, the same is updated.
Due to the use of pointer, you can modify the code to add a book ID and make the search based on book ID or make the search using just one parameter 
giving multiple results, and so on.
